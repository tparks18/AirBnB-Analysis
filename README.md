# Airbnb Analysis Repository

Welcome to my **Airbnb Analysis** repository!  

This project explores factors that contribute to successful Airbnb listings in New York City, using the 2024 Inside Airbnb dataset.

<br>

## Repository Contents
- üìÑ **Research Papers**: Two reference papers that guided parts of my approach.  
- üìù **2-Page Write-Up**: A summary of dataset choice, guiding questions, findings, and challenges.  
- üíª **Jupyter Notebook**: The complete workflow, from data cleaning to exploratory analysis.  
- üåç **Neighborhoods Data**: GeoJSON file used for geographic analysis and visualizations.  

<br>

## Data Notes
- **Listings and Reviews**: Too large to include in this repository. The notebook provides instructions on downloading the data directly from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/) and unzipping the `.gz` files.  
- **Neighborhoods**: The `neighbourhoods.geojson` file is included for mapping and neighborhood-level comparisons.
